Endings, 	Loss 	and 	Grief
7
Your brain will rewire itself to adapt to a new reality 
and you will slowly start to find acceptance of what 
you’ve lost.
Basic 
needs
Self-
actualization
achieving one’s 
full potential, 
including creative 
activities
Psychological 
needs
Self-fulﬁlment 
needs
Esteem needs
prestige, feeling of accomplishment
Belongingness and love needs
intimate relationships, friends
Safety needs
security, safety
Physiological needs
food, water, warmth, rest
Over time the brain rewires itself around the grief 
to accept a life without what was lost

• Contains most of the brain’s
neuronal cell bodies
• Fully develops once a person
reaches their 20s
• Involved in information
processing
• Involved in higher-order
thinking: perception, memory,
learning and decision making
• Able to rewire
• Made up of bundles which
connect various grey matter
areas

• Interprets sensory information
from various parts of the body
• Acts as a communication
network, facilitates the transfer
of information across various
brain areas
• Able to rewire
