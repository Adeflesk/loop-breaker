🌀 LoopBreaker
LoopBreaker is a behavioral engineering platform designed to identify, track, and disrupt self-reinforcing psychological feedback loops. Specifically, it targets the cycle of stress, procrastination, and distorted beliefs using a "Circuit Breaker" software pattern.

Built natively for Apple Silicon (M3).

🎯 Project Aims
Mapping: Translate subjective emotional states into a Directed Cyclic Graph (DCG).

Detection: Use biometrics (Heart Rate) and digital breadcrumbs (Screen Time) to identify the current "Node" in the cycle.

Intervention: Trigger "Circuit Breakers"—forced UI/UX shifts that require the user to perform a grounding task before continuing.

🛠 The Stack
Frontend: Flutter (Mobile/Desktop) - Handles UI and biometric ingestion.

Backend: Python + FastAPI - The orchestration layer.

Intelligence: Ollama (llama3.2:1b) - Local AI for sentiment analysis and state classification.

Database: Neo4j (Graph) - Stores the relationships between emotional states.

✅ CI
GitHub Actions runs backend pytest and frontend Flutter tests on every push and pull request.

🧪 Tests
Backend:
```
python -m pytest backend/tests
```

Frontend:
```
cd frontend
flutter test
```
🧠 The Behavioral Logic (For AI Agents)
The system operates on a 8-Node Feedback Loop. AI agents should refer to this cycle when generating state transition logic:

Stress → Triggered by physiological spikes.

Inability to cope with emotions → Decreased executive function.

Unhelpful coping (Procrastination) → High digital usage/avoidance.

Inability to prioritize needs → Neglecting physical health (sleep/water).

Hypervigilance/Anxiety → Heightened sensitivity to stimuli.

Distorted negative beliefs → Negative self-talk identified via NLP.

Low self-esteem → Long-term state degradation.

Shame → The final gate before the loop restarts at "Stress."

The "Circuit Breaker" Pattern
When the backend identifies a high probability of moving from Node 3 (Procrastination) to Node 4 (Neglecting Needs), the InterventionService must trigger a "hard interrupt" in the frontend.

🚀 Setup for M3
Local AI: ollama serve must be running.

Environment: Use venv in /backend for Python dependencies.

Flutter: Use flutter doctor to ensure the ARM64 toolchain is healthy.

🛡 Privacy & Ethics
Zero-Cloud AI: All sentiment analysis stays on-device via Ollama.

Encryption: Personal health data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256.
